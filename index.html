    <p class = "description">
      According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kid_A">Wikipedia</a>, Thom Yorke
      wrote the lyrics for songs on the album 'Kid A' by cutting up words and phrases and assembling them at random. </BR>This page takes
      the song with the most lyrics, "Idioteque," and rearranges the lines of the song. </BR>  </BR>
      The original is on the left and the rearranged version is on the right. </BR>
      Refresh the page to see another rerranged version!  </BR>
